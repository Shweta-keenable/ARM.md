 # Instruction Sets 
 
 instruction set is a list of all the instructions that a processor can execute. 
 Such instructions include arithmetic operations such as add and subtract, logical operations such as AND, OR and NOT, data instructions such as move, input and output, and control instructions such as goto, call and return. The instruction set specifies the opcodes (machine language operation codes) 
 that are used to identify each instruction.
