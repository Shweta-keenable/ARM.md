 ## Intel Instruction Sets 
 
 Instruction set is a list of all the instructions that a processor can execute. 
 Such instructions include arithmetic operations such as add and subtract, logical operations such as AND, OR and NOT, data instructions such as move, input and output, and control instructions such as goto, call and return. The instruction set specifies the opcodes (machine language operation codes) 
 that are used to identify each instruction.
 
 ## Data transfer instruction
 
These instructions are used to transfer data from one register to another, and from memory to register or from register to memory. And there is no change in the contents of the source register in this.

## Mov-

This instruction copies the contents of the source register to the destination register. Example:- MOV B, C.

## LDA-

This is the load accumulator instruction. It is used to transfer the data present in the memory address to the accumulator. ex:- LDA 1000H.

## Logical instruction 

These instruction sets are used to perform logical and boolean operations in registers or data stored in memory. Eg:- AND, OR, compare, rotate etc.

# ANI-
It performs and operation in immediate 8 bit data given in register and memory. ex:-ANI 65H.

## ORA R/M:-
This instruction completes the OR operation in the data of the accumulator. ex:- ORA B.

## Arithmetic instructions

The instructions of this group perform arithmetic operations such as: - Addition, subtraction, increment, decrement.

## ADD-

It adds the contents of the register or memory to the contents of the accumulator. Example:- ADD B

 

## SUB- 

By this the content of the register or memory location is subtracted from the content of the accumulator. ex:- SUB B or SUB M.

## INR- 

By this the data of register and memory location is incremented by 1. ex:- INR B or INR M.

## Dcr

It decrements the data of register and memory location by 1. ex:- DCR B or DCR M.
