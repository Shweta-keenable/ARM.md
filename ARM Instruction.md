## Memory Instructions: Load and Store

ARM uses a load-store model for memory access which means that only load/store (LDR and STR) instructions can access memory.
ARM would require three types of instructions (load, increment, and store) to first load the value at a particular address 
into a register, increment it within the register, and store it back to the memory from the register.

## First basic example
 LDR is used to load something from memory into a register, and STR is used to store something from a register to a memory address.
